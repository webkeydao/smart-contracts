# WebKey - Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Smart Contract

Welcome to **WebKey**, a decentralized finance (DeFi) project inspired by Anubi, built on Binance Smart Chain (BSC). This repository contains part of the smart contract code powering WebKey's proxy order management system, which will help us drive transparency and community involvement in the project's development. Additional parts of the codebase will be open-sourced gradually as the project matures.

## Overview

WebKey aims to create a secure, scalable, and transparent ecosystem for managing DeFi transactions within a decentralized order system. By leveraging principles from OlympusDAO, we seek to build a resilient protocol with sustainable yield mechanisms and strong governance, empowering users in the Web3 world.

### Key Components

- **Front-End System**: The user interface allowing seamless interaction with the WebKey DeFi platform.
- **Back-End Service**: Validates requests from the front-end and manages secure interactions with the smart contract.
- **Admin Back-End & Front-End**: Tools for administrators to configure, monitor, and manage the platform.
- **On-Chain Monitoring and Management**: Real-time tracking of on-chain transactions and smart contract interactions.

## Features

- **DeFi Order Management**: Enable users to securely create and manage decentralized orders.
- **Community-Driven Development**: Open-sourcing our code to foster transparency and community engagement.
- **Gradual Code Release**: This repository includes only part of our smart contracts. Future releases will expand on available functionalities and documentation.

## Smart Contract Details

- **Blockchain**: Binance Smart Chain (BSC)
- **Protocol Inspiration**: WebKey DAO
- **Language**: Solidity
- **License**: MIT License
